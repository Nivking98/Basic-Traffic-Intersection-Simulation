Simulation to Mimic Pasea Intersection for comparison of algorithms utilized for adaptive signal light timing vs fixed signal light timing using Pygame.

Adapted and very thoroughly editted to focus on traffic at intersection of interest in Trinidad & Tobago. Image was not utilized for intersection like in the original but pygame was used to redesign intersection and add own logic and adjustments. This intersection can be editted to mimic a variety of intersections in Trinidad and Tobago with simple changes to the code manually in order to test how the adaptive signal light timing would perform compared to fixed signal light timing on other intersections of interest.

Accuracy of simulation can be fine tuned by editing speed of vehicles in pixels/second and distance of the each intersection side length as well as the desired queue lengths to mimic either non camaera based and/or camera based sensing.

Further improvements(1) to this simulation would be turning like in original code and also one key idea is to automate the process of intersection and vehicluar speed by giving the user a GUI to interact with to directly alter these parameters based on predefined choices or users personal design choices.

Further improvements(2)  to the adaptive signal light system itself to meet objectives would be the inclusion of algorithm to detect specifically emergency vehicles and assign priority to that intersection side for safety and emergency as well as detect accidents on the intersection side itself.
